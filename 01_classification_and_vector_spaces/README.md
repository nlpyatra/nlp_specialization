# Natural Language Processing Specialization

## Course 1. Classification and Vector Spaces in NLP

**1. Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**

- Implement Logistic Regression from scratch
- Use LR model to classify positive or negative sentiment in tweets

**2. Naïve Bayes for Sentiment Analysis of Tweets**
- Implement Naive Bayes (NB) from scratch
- Use NB model for sentiment analysis

**3. Vector Space Models**

- Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships

**4. Word Embeddings and Locality Sensitive Hashing for Machine Translation**

- Write a simple English-to-French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbors search
